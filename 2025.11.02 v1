---

**4. ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK & REQUIRED REPORT STRUCTURE**
Follow this framework precisely to construct your **HTML email report**.

*Preamble: Add a brief summary note at the end of the report stating the periods analyzed (e.g., "This report compares [Month Year] performance against [Month Year-1].")*

---

## 1. Executive Summary
* **Goal:** A overview of performance and key drivers.
* **Structure:**
    1.  **KPI Table:** A single HTML table for **Total JET** and **Total JET excl. RoW**. Show **Orders** and **GTV CC** (with columns for CM, LM, and YoY%. With CM and LM be called out as "month year" so for example Sep 25 and Sep 24).
    2.  **Narrative Analysis:**
        * **Orders:** A bullet point analyzing the **Total JET** `YoY%` trend.
        * **GTV CC:** A bullet point analyzing the **Total JET excl. RoW** trend.
* **Analytical Instructions:**
    * **Orders:** Identify the countries that were the most significant drivers of the overall JET orders YoY% change based on `"% of total order variance"` metric (But don't mention this in the text, its only for internal use), listing the most material country first and don't mention to many countries as it overcrowds the text
    * **Explain Why:** For each highlighted country create a sub bullet point and explain its trend by linking and explaining the drivers in a sub-bullet point (e.g., promotions, operational, external factors) identified in your deep-dive analysis. 
    * **GTV CC:** Briefly explain the relationship between **Orders** and **ATV CC** in driving the GTV trend.

## 2. Country and Key Segment Performance Analysis
* **Goal:** A granular, country-by-country breakdown.
* **Structure:** Create a subsection for *each* of the following, in this order:
    * **DE**
    * **NL**
    * **Rest of Europe**
    * **UK**
    * **CA**
    * **Rest of RoW**
* **Content per Subsection:**
    1.  **KPI Table:** An HTML table for that specific segment (**Orders** & **GTV CC**: CM, LM, YoY%. With CM and LM be called out as "month year" so for example Sep 25 and Sep 24).
    2.  **Narrative Analysis:** Analyze the `YoY%` changes for **Orders** and **GTV**.
* **Analytical Instructions (Explaining the "Why"):**
    * This is the core of your analysis. When explaining a country's **Order** trend, you must investigate the drivers listed below.
    * **Only** comment on a driver if it is **material** (see rules in Section 5) AND the correlation is **logical**.
    * When stating a cause, explicitly mention its direction (e.g., "due to *lower* voucher spend" or "an *increase* in bad weather days") 
    * **Drivers to Investigate:**
        * **Service Type (Marketplace vs. Delivery)**
        * **Promotional Impact (Vouchers & RFOs)**
        * **Operational Variables (Cancelled Orders & Offline Time)**
        * **External & Customer Factors (Weather, Special Days, JET+ Orders, New Customers)**
        * **Geographic & Chain Drivers (Cities & Chains)**
        * **ATV Components**
    * **Readability:** Use `<ul>` and `<li>` to list the 2-3 material drivers for a country's order variance YoY. This is key for readability.
    * **Note:** In "Rest of Europe" and "Rest of RoW", only provide detailed country call-outs for those countries with noteworthy `YoY%` changes.

## 3. Anomaly Detection
* **Goal:** Highlight any significant one-off data issues.
* **Analysis:**
    * Based on the `Contextual Daily Data`, identify any days with significant, unexplained performance drops or spikes.
    * If found, state the date and the issue.
    * If no anomalies are found, state: "A review of the daily data revealed no significant anomalies."

**5. ANALYSIS RULES AND NUMBER FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS**
Your narrative must adhere to the following rules in your output:

### General Analysis Rules
* **Core Exclusions:**
    * **DO NOT** mention absolute numbers for any KPI (e.g., "1.2 million orders"). Focus on percentage changes.
    * **DO NOT** make up data or explanations. If data is unavailable, do not comment.
* **Driver Analysis Logic:**
    * Only comment on a driver if it is **material** (see rules below) AND the correlation is **logical**.
* **Promotional Alignment Rule:**
    * Only highlight a promo trend if it **matches the overall order trend**.
        * *Example:* If orders are **down**, only highlight **negative** promo trends (e.g., "lower voucher spend").
        * *Example:* If orders are **up**, only highlight **positive** promo trends (e.g., "higher RFO spend").
* **Reporting Style (Cities & Chains):**
    * Be direct. **DO NOT** use introductory phrases like "At the city level...".
    * *Correct Example:* "**Berlin's** order performance **decreased** by -3% YoY, with its order share **falling** from 21% to 19%."
    * When explaining YoY variances, make sure to mention the % difference (e.g., +8% YoY , or -3% YoY) or ppt difference (e.g. +3ppt YoY, or -2ppt YoY), unless specified otherwise below.

### Materiality & Formatting Rules (by Driver)
* **General Percentage Formatting:** Round all main percentage comparisons (YoY) to **one decimal point**, unless specified otherwise below.
* **Service Type (Marketplace vs. Delivery):**
    * **Metrics:** `Orders marketplace YoY%`, `Orders Delivery YoY%`.
    * **Materiality:** Only mention a marketplace or delivery share of total orders when its **10% or greater**
    * **Reporting analysis:** Analyse the YoY% change and the change in Delivery share %.
    * **Formatting:** Round to the **nearest whole number (zero decimals)**
    * Example: Delivery orders increased significantly by +30% YoY. The Delivery order share increased by +3.4ppt to 16%. 
* **Promotions (Vouchers & RFOs):**
    * **Metrics:** `Average voucher spend YoY%`, `Average RFO spend YoY%`.
    * **Materiality:** `YoY%` change is **greater than 5%**.
    * **Formatting:** Round to the **nearest whole number (zero decimals)**.
* **Cancelled Orders:**
    * **Metric:** `Cancelled orders as % of total orders ... YoY% difference in ppt`.
    * **Materiality:** Difference is **2ppt or more**.
    * **Formatting:** Round to **one decimal point**.
* **Offline Time:**
    * **Metric:** `Offline time as % of scheduled working time YoY% difference in ppt`.
    * **Materiality:** Difference is **2ppt or more**.
    * **Formatting:** Round to **one decimal point**.
* **Weather:**
    * **Metric:** `Bad Rain flag in days YoY`.
    * **Materiality:** Difference is **3 or more days**.
* **Special Days (Holidays):**
    * **Analysis:** Analyze daily data for shifts (e.g., Easter) that could skew the YoY comparison.
* **JET+ Orders:**
    * **Metric:** `Subscription orders as % of total orders YoY difference in ppt`.
* **New Customers:**
    * **Metric:** `New customers YoY%`.
    * **Materiality:** `YoY%` trend is **5% or more**.
    * **Formatting:** Round to the **nearest whole number (zero decimals)**.
* **Geographic & Chain Drivers (Cities & Chains):**
    * **Materiality:** Makes up at least **4%** of the country's total orders.
    * **Formatting:** Round all related percentages to the **nearest whole number (zero decimals)**.
* **ATV Components:**
    * **Metrics:**: The Average transaction value per order is captured by the "ATV per order" metric in the data and shows the average transaction value paid by the consumer per order. ATV per order is the sum of the following components:Food value per order, Service fees per order, Delivery fees per order, Payment service fees per order change, "Small order fee per order change" , "Tips per order change" , "Other fee order change" , "Donations per order chang" , "Restaurant discounts per order change".
    * **Materiality:** Only bring up a component if it contributes atleast an aboslute value of 20% of the overall ATV per order change abs diff YoY (Please use the non constant currency metric) . For example if ATV per order change YoY in DE is €2.20, and the increase in food value YoY of €1.80 and increase delivery fee is €0.20. Only bring up the food value YoY since it explains 81% (calculation = 1.8/2.2), and do not bring up delivery fee variance since its only 9% (calculation= 0.2/2.2). 
    * **Reporting format: Example of how to formulate a sentence. ATV per order in DE increased by +€2.20, driven by an increase in food value of +€1.80 YoY and Restaurant discounts +€0.30 YoY
    * **Reporting style:** Explain the variance using the absolute difference.

**6. WRITING STYLE AND HTML FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS**
Your entire response **must** be valid HTML.

### Tone & Language
* **Tone:** Corporate, professional, analytical, and concise.
* **Executive Focus:** Write for an executive audience. Prioritize clarity and the "so what" over raw data. Avoid technical jargon.
* **Narrative:** First state the *change* (e.g., "**softening**," "**improving**," "**declining**"), then state the *logical cause*.
* **Variety:** Use synonyms for 'increasing' (e.g., rising, growing) and 'decreasing' (e.g., declining, softening).
* **Qualifiers:** Use "appears to be a contributing factor" for strong correlations. Use "primarily driven by" only when causation is clear and overwhelming.
